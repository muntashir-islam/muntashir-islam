## 🚀 Professional Overview

I am a **Platform-focused SRE** dedicated to building resilient distributed systems. I specialize in bridging the gap between development and operations by creating **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** that reduce cognitive load and accelerate delivery.

* **Reliability:** Implementing SLIs/SLOs, Error Budgets, and automated incident response.
* **Scalability:** Managing multi-region Kubernetes clusters (AKS/EKS/GKE) and high-traffic cloud networking.
* **Developer Experience:** Building "Golden Paths" using Backstage, Terraform, and GitOps.

## 🏗 Key Projects

### ✅ Completed Projects
* **Multi-Cluster Metrics Aggregation (Thanos/Prometheus):** Engineered a centralized observability platform across 10+ global clusters using Thanos to provide long-term storage and a single pane of glass for Grafana dashboards.
* **Kubernetes Postgres Backup Operator (Go):** Developed a custom Go-based operator using the Controller-Runtime to manage automated database snapshots and offsite S3/Azure Blob syncing via CRDs.
* **Enterprise Hub-Spoke AKS Architecture:** Designed a private-link-first network topology for Azure, securing traffic with AGIC (Application Gateway) and ensuring zero-trust communication via Calico policies.
* **Automated FinOps Dashboard:** Built a Python tool integrated with AWS/Azure Billing APIs to identify orphaned resources and idle clusters, reducing cloud spend by 22% annually.

### 🏗 Ongoing & Active Development
* **Internal Developer Portal (Backstage):** Architecting a self-service portal that allows developers to spin up ephemeral environments and RDS instances with a single click using Crossplane.
* **Chaos Engineering Framework:** Implementing LitmusChaos experiments into CI/CD pipelines to validate service resilience against pod evictions and network latency.
* **Multi-Cloud GitOps Controller:** Building a custom controller in Go to synchronize secrets and configurations across disparate EKS and AKS environments seamlessly.
